User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs) are decentralized, capabilities model authorization tokens.

UCAN is a trustless, secure, local-first, user-originated authorization and revocation scheme. UCAN is designed to be very flexible: you can use it offline, online, fully P2P, federated, or with central servers.

Please see the [specs](https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/) for more detail on implementation.

If you're interested in contributing to the development of UCANs, check out the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/discussions).
